## 1. Summary
- **What**: Added `ProblemTextEditor` and `PreviewBlock` shared components and refactored `FreeTextEdit` to compose them. Added tests and an implementation report.
- **Why**: Improve maintainability and consistency across problem edit UIs; centralize Markdown/LaTeX preview and sanitization.

## 2. Files Added / Modified
- **Added**: `src/components/common/ProblemTextEditor.tsx`
- **Added**: `src/components/common/PreviewBlock.tsx`
- **Added**: `src/components/common/__tests__/ProblemTextEditor.test.tsx`
- **Modified**: `src/components/problemTypes/FreeTextEdit.tsx` (now composes `ProblemTextEditor`)
- **Modified**: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS/ (added new report)

## 3. Verification
- Unit tests added for `ProblemTextEditor`.
- All existing tests across problem types passed locally after refactor.

## 4. Notes & Next Steps
- Further refactor: replace direct textareas in other Edit components with `ProblemTextEditor` (MultipleChoiceEdit already uses it for question/answer preview in subsequent PRs).
- Consider adding `CodeEditorWrapper` for Programming problems (heavy component, lazy-loaded).
